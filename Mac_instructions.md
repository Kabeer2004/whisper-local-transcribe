### How to run on Mac
Unfortunately, I have not found a permament solution for this, not being a Mac user has limited the ways I can test this.  
#### Recommended steps
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root folder (the downloaded the folder). 
    1. You can also right-click (or equivalent) on the root folder to open a Terminal within the folder.
2. Run the following command:
```
python main.py
```
