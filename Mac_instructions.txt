### How to run on Mac
Unfortunately, I have not found a permament solution for this, not being a Mac user has limited the ways I can test this. For now, these are the recommended steps for a beginner user:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root folder (transcribe-main if you downloaded the folder). You can also right-click (or equivalent) on the root folder to open a Terminal within the folder.
2. Run the following command: 
python GUI.py
