[0.00 --> 7.36]: We're joined once again by our travel expert and also author of America's Top Roller Coasters
[7.36 --> 9.20]: in Amusement Parks, Pete Tribuco.
[9.20 --> 11.04]: Good morning and welcome back to Daybreak USA.
[11.04 --> 13.48]: Well, thanks for having me on.
[13.48 --> 18.90]: If someone's lucky enough to go on vacation to an exotic location and then maybe not so
[18.90 --> 24.86]: lucky to have some kind of a disaster happen while they're there, maybe some civil unrest,
[24.86 --> 26.20]: what should they do now?
[26.20 --> 27.20]: What's the next step?
[27.84 --> 31.56]: Well, whenever you're going on vacation, whether it's locally or internationally, you've got
[31.56 --> 33.08]: to be very careful.
[33.08 --> 38.88]: Obviously, natural disasters, they pop up, or man-made disasters pop up pretty quickly.
[38.88 --> 42.80]: You want to make sure that you've got a few things when you're on vacation that's important.
[42.80 --> 45.10]: Number one, always stay informed.
[45.10 --> 48.64]: When you're traveling, it's easy to find yourself, you know, distant from the world.
[48.64 --> 51.92]: Always know what's happening in that area that you're going to.
[51.92 --> 55.84]: You know, always check and see what the conditions are.
[55.88 --> 60.48]: And sometimes it's a place you might not want to go to, so always check that.
[60.48 --> 64.16]: And, you know, of course, check out all the different weather alerts.
[64.16 --> 69.20]: If it's a hurricane season, for example, make sure that you're aware of that.
[69.20 --> 74.60]: If an incident does happen, stay with a group, get a buddy, you know, travel with a buddy
[74.60 --> 78.88]: or somebody that you can basically go to so that you're not alone.
[78.88 --> 84.04]: Obviously, you want to make sure that if there's any type of a disaster, that you have a plan
[84.04 --> 85.04]: in place.
[85.08 --> 90.44]: Now, the one big thing I think everyone should do is invest in travel insurance.
[90.44 --> 95.00]: No matter where you are, no matter where you go, if you have that insurance program in
[95.00 --> 100.48]: place and know what the limitations and scenarios that it covers, it's good to have it.
[100.48 --> 104.88]: It's well worth paying the little extra dollars to enjoy your vacation.
[104.88 --> 109.08]: And, of course, connect back with your home base, you know.
[109.08 --> 113.68]: When you travel, you want to let people know where you're at, where you're going to be.
[113.72 --> 118.32]: Maybe have an itinerary with the embassy if you're going, you know, overseas and make
[118.32 --> 121.44]: sure that everyone knows where you're at at any given time.
[121.44 --> 127.08]: And, of course, during a disaster, the American Red Cross is pretty much everywhere.
[127.08 --> 132.96]: You want to find a location, depending on the situation of what has happened.
[132.96 --> 137.96]: And they'll be able to set you up, you know, with care packages and stuff along those lines.
[137.96 --> 138.96]: Great advice, Pete.
[138.96 --> 141.16]: Do you have a website where you can get more information?
[141.40 --> 148.84]: Yes, it is www.americasrollercoasters.tatepublishing.net.
[148.84 --> 149.84]: Excellent, Pete.
[149.84 --> 150.84]: Thanks so much.
[150.84 --> 155.72]: And hopefully, hopefully that'll keep some people safe on their big vacation this summer.
[155.72 --> 161.28]: At least having that information should help people feel a little safer anyway.
[161.28 --> 162.28]: It sure would.
[162.28 --> 163.28]: Thank you so much, sir.
[163.28 --> 164.28]: We'll talk again soon.
[164.28 --> 165.28]: Have a great day.
